# Crypto Price Tracker
This is the code for a simple cryptocurrency tracker created using a Raspberry Pi. a 16x2 I2C LCD, and a One Pin Keypad, along with a few other miscellaneous components. Since this project uses Python to connect to the CoinGecko API, you can easily add support for other cryptocurrencies beyond the three (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin) included in the code for this code.
